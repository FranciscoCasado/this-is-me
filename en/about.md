        <h2>Hi!</h2>
        <p>My name is Francisco, I'm an Electrical Engineer and I love putting technology at people's service.</p>
        <p>I teach classes at the University of Chile since 2019 and I dedicate myself to mentor and promote student projects related to tech innovation.</p>

### I have a dream:
>*"I want Chile to have a world-class industry of technological products and systems."*

I teach classes as a way of pursuing that dream. I also teach because I am good at it (as I have been told by others) and because I really enjoy learning from my students.

### Using computers is one of my earliest memories
I was luck that my mother worked (she still does) at a biotechnology research lab. She bought a computer for our home when I was 5 years old. She made signed me up for an e-mail address when I was 8 (wich I still use). I built my own computer when I was 12 and, luckily, I learn to code at the age of 13, but it never drove my attention until I finished engineering school.

My passion for computers started when I realized and understood, thoroughly, how they work and the impact of their development since the invention of the transistor. I decided to build this page because learnig about the web felt as a duty to me.
### The love for crafts & arts
When I was 7, my parents gave me a little book with diagrams for folding origami figures. Since then, the passion for *crafting* objects with my own hands has deep-rooted in me and I love learning different techniques of manipulating matter to create *things*. If I had not studied engineering, I would have studied industrial design.


Last years, and thanks to my studies, I have learned digital design and fabrication techniques. Some of these topics are posted in my [blog](https://blog.franciscocasado.cl).



### Sometimes I take pictures
... and upload them to my Flickr :point_down:
