# This is me
Hi there!

My name is Francisco and this repo contains all the source code for building my webpage at [franciscocasado.cl](http://franciscocasado.cl). I use [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) as the base template for this site, which is a theme that works with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

You can use any line of code you may find useful in this repo, as long as you comply with de [MIT license](LICENSE.md) :)
## About Hyde

Hyde is a brazen two-column [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that pairs a prominent sidebar with uncomplicated content. It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler.
