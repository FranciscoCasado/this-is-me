# This is me
Hi there!

My name is Francisco and this repo contains all the source code for building my webpage at [franciscocasado.cl](http://franciscocasado.cl). I use [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) as the base template for this site, which is a theme that works with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

Hyde is a brazen two-column [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that pairs a prominent sidebar with uncomplicated content. It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com) and has been developed by [Mark Otto](https://github.com/mdo).

I have implemented Jekyll Multilingual support by following [this guide](https://forestry.io/blog/creating-a-multilingual-blog-with-jekyll/) by [DJ Walker](https://github.com/dwalkr). He provides also provides a [sample site repo](https://github.com/dwalkr/jekyll-multilingual).
